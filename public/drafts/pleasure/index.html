<p>All the bad is the normal.
What we dreaded, now we dance with it.
Virtue? That's but a name only.
Duty? Is it pleasureful?</p>
<p>Have we forgotten who we are?
Are we not superior to wild beasts?
Are our acts different then?
Is our reasoning any fruitful?
Why then all this vice?</p>
<p>Give me a good feeling.
All the pleasure, let it kill me.
I am mortal.</p>
<p>Good is of old.
We are the new.
We are the dying</p>
