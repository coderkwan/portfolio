                <h1>The Journey Will Teach You</h1>
<p><sup><em>04-04-2025</em><sup></p>
<p>End of January, this year, I left the job that I got in the beginning of that same month. It was not a bad job. I loved the tasks, I hated the leader. I was not intending to leave earlier, I was planning to work there for at least a year. But I couldn't take it anymore, the boss sucked; he was controlling, bad mouthing his employees to other employees, he thought we were stealing his money, he loved unpaid overtime.</p>
<p>I reached my boiling point when he gave me unbelievable stories on payday. I was not ready to go home that day empty handed. I needed the paycheck so bad. But he said there was no money to pay us. And I did not accept that. I left that place at 9 PM, waiting for my paycheck.</p>
<p>I got the paycheck and never looked back.
I decided to start freelancing. I paid R200 for Facebook ads. I got the messages, the enquiries, people bought the services. I was selling graphic design and web development.</p>
<p>February, that first month of freelancing was hectic. I took every job, even jobs that we outside my skill and resource set; printing jobs, engraving, clothe branding jobs .e.t.c. These jobs required a lot of travelling and outsourcing which quickly worn me out.
I had to change.</p>
<p>I decided to narrow down my services into only design and web dev; the things I can do myself. And with this simple change, things got better. I was travelling less and not outsourcing anything.</p>
<p>It wasn't too late until I realized another problem; There was too much work but little money. I work all day and half the night but where’s the money? Well, I was pricing my services too cheap. I had to take more jobs to compensate low prices. It had to change.</p>
<p>There is also a mistake I was committing; working first and getting paid later. This was a bad Idea. Some clients will change their minds and drop the project I worked on for hours or days. And I just wasted my precious time. Never do creative work unless there is an upfront payment. Whoever carries the money has more power. I had to change that as well. Now I take a 50% deposit upfront.</p>
<p>All this adjustments were taught to me by experience. Everyday the craft and industry of freelancing is teaching me something. And for me grow I have to grasp and adhere to these lessons as much as I can. There is no need for me to resist change. Yes change is hard, but it’s usually for the better.</p>
<p>I did not have to take a class on freelancing. I dove head-first, and now I am better than I were before. Freelancing was very scary to me. Thank God I took the risk. And one thing that will make me better is observing my failures and mistakes then learn from those. Experience is indeed the best teacher.</p>
<p>Whatever you want to do; Just start. You will never be ready. The journey will teach you the right path. The failures will show you the road to success.</p>
