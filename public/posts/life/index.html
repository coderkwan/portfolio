                <h1>The cost of a good life</h1>
<p><sup><em>23-06-2025</em><sup></p>
<p>Having a good life is not easy. Being successful financially, in relationships, in health and in attaining happiness is not that cheap. There is a price to be paid. But this price is not unaffordable, everyone is able to start paying ASAP.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;No man is so poor that he cannot begin to pay for what he want.&quot;</strong> - William George Jordan</p>
<h2>Sacrifice</h2>
<p>The giving up of something good, important and fun in hope for something way better. This is a habit we must develop if we want a good life. There are a lot of good and enjoyable things in life, but it does not mean they are important in advancing your life.</p>
<p>It's important to know where you are going so you can eliminate everything that's not part of your journey, no matter how good and interesting it seems.</p>
<h2>Patience</h2>
<p>This is the realisation that some events and projects cannot be forced into completion. A thousand mile journey begins and continues one step at a time. Trying to take 3 steps at a time will lead to failure and damage. Attaining mastery or general success in any field takes time, it requires waiting, believing and trusting the process.</p>
<h2>Persistence</h2>
<p>This is the art of showing up everyday. This is one of the main differences between failures and those successful. Successful people don't easily give-up on what they believe in. They show up everyday no-matter the challenges, no-matter recent failures. They perceive a new day as an opportunity to try again, as an opportunity to keep moving.</p>
<p>Payouts may not be realized immediately, keep pushing, show up everyday, payday will eventually come.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;He who holds his breath the longest wins.&quot;</strong> - Gary Vee</p>
<h2>Embracing Change</h2>
<p>When things are not working out and they are not likely to improve, just embrace and implement change.</p>
<p>It is important to have a clear judgement about things around you. It's important to detach yourself. Yes, persistence is important, but persisting in the wrong direction will kill you internally, it will drain your energy.</p>
<p>If it's clear that things are heading south; that is a call for change. Creating a good life requires one to be comfortable with change.</p>
<p>A good book on embracing change: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Who-Moved-My-Cheese-Amazing/dp/0399144463">Who Moved My Cheese</a></p>
<h2>Taking risks</h2>
<p>Playing the game of life in comfort mode may give you mediocre results. But extreme results emerge when you take leaps of faith. Keep on taking risks. Not the ones that will lend you in jail or wipe your entire bank account. A good risk is one with 1% damage and 100% return.</p>
