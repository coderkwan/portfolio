# My case against camelCase

<sup>_26-09-2023_<sup>

I haven't been thinking much about how I name my variables. I was just flowing with the community or sometimes using the conversion already applied in the codebase am working on.
When writing Python, I usually use `snake_case` and when writing JavaScript, it's mostly `camelCase` as it is the most common naming conversion in the JS community.

Personally, I find `camelCase` a bad naming conversion; simply because it slows me down when reading code. It's just hard to read WordsWhichAreTiedTogether.

It's easier to read `display_values` than to read `displayValues`.

When browsing through a huge codebase and trying to understand how the code works; `snake_case` will make things better. That's why we have spaces between every word in our English grammar, it improves readability.
