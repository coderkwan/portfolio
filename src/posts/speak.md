# Speak from fresh lips

<sup>_01-01-2025_<sup>


Yesterday my younger sister disrespected me, I rebuked her. But today is not as yesterday, I should not continue with my yesterday way of speaking. I'll address her as today fits. With fresh lips.

The way you speak to different people varies. You don't speak to your boss as you would your spouse. To your boss you're more respective and professional, to your spouse more casual and maybe romantic. You're addressing them as their status demands. 

The position an individual holds in your life is not the only factor that determines how you address them. The person's knowledge, wisdom, reputation; all such can play a role on how you speak to individuals. You disclose more to those you trust, you speak simply and with more emphasis to those you deem ignorant, you try to sound wise to the wise.

And the way one speaks to a person can be a habit. Which is something you must avoid. If you speak aggressively to your wife; that can develop into a habit and you'll find yourself aggressive in things that don't require aggression. If you usually lie to your boss, you'll  be in the habit of lying unnecessary.

We've talked more about addiction to substances and addiction to actions. We should also pay careful attention to the way we communicate with those around us. Don't be addicted to a certain way of addressing a person. Always speak with fresh lips, always listen with fresh ears. Don't address me as I was yesterday, perceive what I am today and what the situation demands, then address me as suitable. 

We speak to spread ideas, to entertain, to rebuke, to let others know what we think and feel. Each moment calls for a specific way of speaking. Know when to rebuke, know when to complement, know when to entertain. Don't judge and speak to individuals from past experiences. Try to know and address them in the present. 

"Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech" - 1 Peter 3:10-12
