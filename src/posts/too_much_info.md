# Too much information, I can't think

<sup>_10-09-2025_<sup>

Humans, we are tribal, we are social, and we enjoy living together peacefully. We share values, ideas and opinions.
This means conformity at some level. And with the increase of information and busyness; people don't have time to make their own decisions. They outsource decision-making to the tribe.


The information flood leads to the paradox of choice (having more choices becomes overwhelming and leads to less overall satisfaction.) We have so much information we don't know what to do with it. We have so many choices, we don't know what to choose.


Making the wrong decision feels awful, that's why we consult the tribe for the right decisions. The more we do it, the weaker our self-reliance gets. We slowly lose trust to our independent reasoning. That's why there is a rise in reaction videos, in reviews, in commentaries. People don't want to be wrong, people don't want to stand alone. They go with the tribe.


We own the same furniture, we read the same books, we have the same mentors, we speak the same language, we listen to the same music, we watch the same movies, we use the same systems.


We are slowly losing the ability to analyze and conclude independently. We read reviews before we buy, we consult recommendation sites. We don't pave our own path. We choose the well defined route.
