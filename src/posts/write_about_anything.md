# Write about anything

<sup>_16-09-2024_<sup>

There was a time when I thought writing was about telling stories. Obviously, I was wrong! Not all books are novels, not all genres are amusing us with tales. Even if we get a story from the author, it is usually means to portray a certain message. That message can be teaching us, warning us or thrilling, whatever it may be, words are just ‘fingers pointing to the moon’.

You don’t have be a story teller to write. As long as you can think, then you can write. Writing is like talking, but in an organized way, with ink. There are enormous subjects to write about, which don’t require the creativity of formulating stories and plots. Leave telling stories to those good at it.

You can explore a lot of fields; history, science and all the non-fiction stuff. Or write about things that bother or interest you. What are things that annoy you? What believes do people hold that you disagree or agree with? We want to read about that! What were you busy with during the weekend? That would be an interesting read.

The inability to create stories of fiction should not be an excuse. Just put your thoughts down in an organized, consistent and seamless way.
Anyone who can think can write. Writing will also enhance your reasoning. The more you do it, the easier it become.
