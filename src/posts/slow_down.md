# Slow down and be happy

<sup>_22-03-2025_<sup>

I hate walking fast, I hate rushing things and I hate being rushed. Maybe that's why I naturally speak slow, It's who I am, I love it when things are slow. You will never find me walking fast. Even when I am late, I just accept it.

As a freelancer or a professional it is common to experience different waves of emotion during your working day; stressed, calm, mad, happy, frustration, e.t.c. When I track the bad emotions; they arise from hurry; being rushed, chasing a deadline, having a lot to do in a limited time.

Rushing a project or fighting a deadline puts me in a state where I can't even think clearly. And I have noticed; when there is a lot of stuff to do, procrastination rises, indecision dominates.

I have realized that I am more happy and enjoy what I do when I don't have to rush the task through. 

*How then do I slow down my day, so that I become happy and get to enjoy what I do?*

## 1. Scheduling
You have limited time and limited resources. The best way to use you time is to distribute it evenly among the important tasks you have to complete.

Using your hours randomly will not work, there are some tasks you wont attend. You'll find yourself doing only the fun stuff, the boring tasks will be left unattended. But **with a schedule, that is respected, all tasks will be completed at the right time**.


## 2. Concentration
When you're performing a task, do that task only; **focus**. Don't let your mind wonder around. **Concentration is the key to getting things done fast and done well.**

## 3. Go play
When you're done working take a break, go play. Do something else, go chop some wood, play the piano, read a book, visit a friend. **Don't be a slave to your work**.
