#  Stack experiences not regret

<sup>_28-07-2025_<sup>

We have a lot of ideas and desires, and most of them we don't pursue, we ignore. We will never know if they were any good. Fear has prevented us from reaping the fruits of our own imagination.

There are desires which are obviously bad; those that result to more harm than good. Those we must shun.
But desiring to visit a country, desiring to learn a language, to acquire a skill; that's not bad, that's worth pursuing.

And if you leave such desires unattended, your chances of regret increases. We regret the actions we don't take more than the ones we take. And why do we regret? Because we know there was something valuable to be attained from that experience, even if we tried and failed.

We are usually hindered by fear, fear that our ideas are bad and bound to fail.
But the only way to see if your idea is bad and bound to fail is to try it.
And the quicker you do it, the better.

**Execute fast on your ideas to make way for new ideas. Attain your desires fast, to make way for new experiences.**

The more you stack unattained desires, the greater will be the regret in the future.

Life as an adventure, don't be scared to try things out. **Stack experiences not regret.**
