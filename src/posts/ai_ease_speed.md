# Artificial Intelligence, Ease and Speed

<sup>_03-04-2025_<sup>


In programming, there was a time when we had no auto completions and no linters; you had to refer to the language specification to know possible methods calls and the right syntax (imagine your keyboard without auto correction and auto suggestion).  And now you just type a single character and possible solutions pop in the screen, with clear documentation and even examples. You don’t have to buy books or download long specs and docs. I believe when auto completion and linters came out some programmers were freaked. The thought they were getting replaced.


But it turned out that these tools made writing code a lot easier and quicker. Maybe that’s the same promise AI is delivering; ease and speed.


Think of AI as an enhancement tool not a replacement tool. Machinery did not take farmers out of business but it made farming easier and better. Machinery automated the tedious stuff, leaving farmers with time to solve other critical problems. Automobiles made transportation easier. Streaming sites made entertainment accessible. The conclusion is “with change things got better”, and that's good for humanity.


The beef with AI is that people are going to lose their jobs, people are going to be more stupid. Well, that’s not entirely the case. Yes the jobs part will change; new job titles will emerge, old titles will be irrelevant. Things that were time consuming will be now easier, boring tasks will be automated.


Artificial intelligence is a tool. Like every other tool, created to make things better, to bring improvement. In no time it will part of our everyday usage and it will unlock more possibilities for future innovations.


You role is to find, in your daily life, the boring tasks, the difficult tasks and see if AI cannot ease your burdens. But you should never ever compromise quality. If you can do it better than AI then do it yourself.


Change is hard, the sooner you embrace it, the better.
