# The artist, in her own world

<sup>_17-10-2024_<sup>

She doesn't create music that will make them dance, 
She only cares if it makes her move.

The artist remains in her own world. 
She creates what she loves, with little care of what the world wants.

She is shocked when others love her work. She is unique.
She does not dwell on praises; she desires to remain creative.

The artist creates something new everyday. She exceeds and fails expectations.

Some can be disappointed at her work, but she is always mesmerized.

The artist has no goals to meet. No targets to hit.
She creates.

Whatever her hand touches, behold, perfection.

She pours her heart, her soul, all into her work.

In her art she finds comfort, she finds truth.

Her work is a genuine reflection of herself.
Her emotions are written all over it.

She smiles, she cries, she laughs, she creates.

The artist.
