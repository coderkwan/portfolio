# Seek Originals

<sup>_20-06-2025_<sup>

I have watched a lot of YouTube and read a ton of blogs in the past 3 years. With my main focus on productivity and self improvement. At first I was enjoying this content, it was motivating me to get stuff done.

But now things have changed, the content does not hit the same spot. It does not get my blood running. Everything the YouTubers are talking about; I already know, everyone knows it, It's what all the other content creators are saying. There is no depth; all of them are scrapping the surface.

Are they imitating each other? Are they drinking from the same source?

Truths is; it's damn hard to be original, It's not easy to be a rebel. But that's what we crave for. That's what we're scrolling for. Give us your true self, tell us your own thoughts, in your own words. Then we will be satisfied.

Don't just transfer ideas from books, blogs and videos directly as it is. Add your own touch, enhance it, personalize it, own it.

It's easy for consumers to succumb and accept this drought; indulging in surface content which lacks authenticity. I challenge you to seek depth, to dig for originality. Don't waste time learning from imitators; find the source. Find the original rock where that idea was cut from.

We are inspired by novelty, by great works of art. Not by surface inauthentic ideas.
To be different, consume and think differently.
To learn about an idea, seek the originals.
