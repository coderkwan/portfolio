# Give me pleasure

<sup>_01-09-2025_<sup>

All the bad is the normal.
What we dreaded, now we dance with it.
Virtue? That's but a name only.
Duty? Is it pleasureful?

Have we forgotten who we are?
Are we not superior to wild beasts?
Are our acts different then?
Is our reasoning any fruitful?
Why then all this vice? 

Give me a good feeling.
All the pleasure, let it kill me.
I am mortal.

Good is of old. 
We are the new.
We are the dying
