# Be who you are

<sup>_12-07-2025_<sup>


It is easy to be caught up in ideas or prejudices of what we are. I am continuously troubled by folks under this vice. A lot of people identify themselves with titles that don't resemble their current affairs.

How can you be a carpenter without handling and shaping wood? If you confess to be a writerâ€” I must see your writings. Your life must testify of your titles.

Don't tell me you use to write a few years ago. Why then do you still call yourself one? If you have changed, your titles must not lag. It is easy to lie to ourselves, even concerning desired skills. An aspiring artist will call himself an artist without producing any noticeable painting. We have, as a society, accepted it. We focus on names and badges more than actions.

I shall no-longer lie to myself. No-one is interested in my past or concerned about my future. I will profess boldly what I am at present. If I desire to be a singer, I will not call myself one until I sing. If I once was a preacher, and no-longer preach, I must cease to deceive myself and my fellows. I am what I am now.
