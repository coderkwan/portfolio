# Love the good stuff

<sup>_30-05-2025_<sup>

We are in an information age, where quantity triumphs over quality, Where art and content are vomited by AI.

It's now hard to come across good stuff, It's hard to stumble upon originality.

But when you do come across the good stuff, the good blog, the good music, the good book, the good clip, the good quote, the good movie; **Consume it. Think about it. Treasure it. Save it. Share it, Re-visit it.**
