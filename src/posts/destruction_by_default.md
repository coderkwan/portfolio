# Forced to be destructed

<sup>_10-07-2025_<sup>

It is increasingly getting harder to focus. Everything is now built with destruction as a feature. The car; now has TV, games, and you can connect your phone to receive calls. It is not solely for transportation but a bunch of other things as well, good enough to get you destructed.

Enough about cars. What caught my attention was the internet, mostly social platforms; blogs, social media, streaming platforms. In all these platforms it is impossible to focus on one thing. As you watch this video, 7 other videos are  pushed in your face. As you're reading a post, 14 adverts and 3 recommended posts are shoved down your throat. You can't be satisfied with what you're consuming, you're also longing for that glittering algorithm-recommended clip on the sidebar.

It is clear that  most creators and manufactures care less about your time and satisfaction. The responsibility is left with you. You are the one to pave your way to a focused life. You are the armed guard of your precious time. All this click temptations must be resisted through will power.

Because all platforms are destruction packed by default, it is now a norm, people are hardly aware of it. They hide it under multi-tasking.

Now understand why folks like Cal Newport preach about digital minimalism; it is hard to resist the algorithm. It is well designed not just to destruct you but to tempt you and keep you on the platform as long as possible.

Take good care of your precious time, treasure your valuable mind. Don't be a puppet, resist destruction.
