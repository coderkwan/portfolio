# Imposter Syndrome is good

<sup>_17-04-2024_<sup>

You shouldn't beat yourself up because you feel like you're not a 10x developer.

The feeling of mastering a technology or a programming language might actually hinder you from learning. Yet the imposter feeling propels you into constantly developing yourself. The tech world is constantly changing at a rapid pace; you can't be satisfied with your current knowledge. You have to keep learning. You are forced to remain a student your entire career.

The imposter feeling is a sign that there is more to learn. It is motivation. Motivation for growth. You don't have to try to get rid of it, instead embrace it, and keep on developing yourself.

Don't let the feeling lead you into disqualifying yourself. It should only remind you that there is always something new to learn. There are always new challenges to conquer.

Never allow imposter syndrome to rob you of your confidence. Use it as fuel for growth.
