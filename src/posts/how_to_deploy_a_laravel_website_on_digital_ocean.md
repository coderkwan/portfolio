# How to deploy a Laravel website on Digital Ocean
<sup>_08-03-2024_<sup>

This post assumes that you already know the basics of Laravel and you have a Digital Ocean's account. If you don't have an account; [sign up](https://m.do.co/c/1e4c77d1fc93) ( there are some free credits, no need to pay at first. ). And to learn more about Laravel; check their awesome [docs](https://Laravel.com/docs).

## Set up a Laravel app

First let's create a Laravel app. You can skip this part if you already have an app built, and just focus on the next configuration steps.

`composer create Laravel/Laravel my_cool_app`

Install dependencies

`cd my_cool_app && npm install`

Update the following .env variables to match your local or development database. We have to make sure the app works locally before we push it to production.

Start your local servers with `npm run dev` and `php artisan serve`.
If your app runs well, then we off to a good start.

## Adding routes

I will just add an extra `about` route for this demonstration.

***web.php***

Both my views are rendering one `h1` tag.

***welcome.blade.php***

***about.blade.php***

## Make sure vite is configured correctly
If you notice on the above views; I am using vite to include my custom css file.
`@vite(['resouces/css/custom.css'])`

I need to make sure that I include this file in the`vite.config.js` inputs array:

***vite.config.js***

## Enforce https on production
Our final step will be enforcing https for secure connections on production.
Let up update our app service provider `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`.

***app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php***

## Deploying to Digital Ocean
Now that everything is set locally. Make sure you push your code to github. And Digital Ocean will point to that repository.

Click edit, next to your Laravel app , **not next to Global**.

Add all the following variables.

For the APP_KEY, copy your local key from the .env file. (The key can be generated by `php artisan key:generate`).
