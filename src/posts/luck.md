#  I saw 2 snakes in 3 days. I was lucky.

<sup>_21-12-2024_<sup>

This gave me a clear picture of how luck works. I was concerned of why I wasn't seeing any snakes yet I was walking in nature almost daily. It turned out that I was walking in places where snakes don't hang-out. I was walking in parks and near busy roads.


Later this year, in October, I returned to my habit of visiting mountains for both prayer and meditation. The mountain I chose this time is not distant; It's a 10 minute walk from where I reside.


One day, unexpectedly, while searching for good spot for prayer, a light-brown snake, about 50 centimeters long, passed in-front of me, about a meter ahead. It instantly vanished into the tall grass which almost covered the narrow path. 


About 2 days later, in the same mountain, in a different spot, after meditation, while sitting under a cool shade, I saw another snake, it was small, dark-brown, it's head raised like a cobra, it was stirring at me, about 1.5 meters away. I jumped with shock, but I was not scared, it was a baby snake.


I just saw 2 snakes in 3 days,. After not seeing any for almost a year.


This is a clear proof that indeed, as Scott Adams says, luck can be manipulated. You can become more lucky by being in the place where luck happens. My odds for seeing snakes drastically increased by simply spending more time in places where snakes hangout.


Be in the place where luck happens.
