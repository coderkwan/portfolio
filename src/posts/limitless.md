# Permitted limitations

<sup>_05-09-2024_<sup>

Men is not limited except when he permits it. Whether in skill, possessions or virtue, you are what you accept. That which you believe eventually and undeniably becomes true.

A 'rich' man feels poor because he thinks what he have is not enough. A 'poor' widow can be fulfilled because she is content with her little possessions. The widow never compares herself.

If limitations can be created by beliefs, so can success, greatness and fulfilment.

A shoemaker who thinks high of himself will produce great work and mistakes will shun his hands. His confidence will reflect in his work. His art will testify.

As a men thinketh in his heart, so is he.
