# How to be productive and get stuff done

<sup>_06-03-2025_<sup>

The ever-increasing number of productivity books, podcasts, talks and videos is a clear sign that a lot of us are struggling to get stuff done. 
We procrastinate, the to-do list is long and boring; where should I start? Will I even finish?

Don’t worry! Here are simple tips I’ve been using that continuously help me get stuff done.

## Avoid creating a pile
You have limited time; 24 hours a day. Every task you receive is like a stone, which piles up on top of existing stones. The more tasks you receive, the taller and bigger the pile gets. Completing a task clears the pile.

You should avoid creating a pile of tasks; attend to tasks as soon as they arrive. Do things as quickly as you can, even when the deadline is out of sight. If you have a to-do list, it should be your goal to keep it as lean or as empty as possible. 

## Break it down, Simplify it
Some tasks are hard to complete, we perceive them as challenging. These are the big stones; immovable. One trick to move a big stone is to break it down into smaller pieces, and ta-dah! Now its movable.
If a task seems hard or complex, break it down into smaller, doable tasks. Don’t try to bite the whole thing, chop it, slice it. Don’t try to swallow it all; chew it first.

## Be limited by time not completion
Tasks are not created equal. Some small, some big, some simple, some complex. Completing a task in one sitting will not work for complex tasks. You can wash dishes in one go, but you can’t write a book in one sitting.

Complex tasks should be scheduled periodically; allocate time and focus on doing as much as you can in that period. In the case of writing a book, you can dedicate an hour a day instead of trying to write the whole thing in one sitting. That’s why a schedule matters; It’s a time limiter; it distributes your time generously.
But you have to create deadlines where possible. Deadlines will fuel you into completing tasks.


## Work and recharge
It takes energy, focus and concentration to get stuff done. You will run out of these if you don’t rest. Working hard is good but what matters even more is effectiveness. You can be active and yet ineffective at the same time. You must make sure you are productive and not just active.

Getting enough rest, taking enough breaks will generate the energy and the focus you need to get stuff done. Your body is your most valuable asset, take care of it, get enough sleep. Recharge when the batteries are low.


## Important things first
Again, not all tasks are created equal, some are important than others. Before devouring that to-do list; first arrange your tasks in order of importance. Do the important things first. Even when you create a schedule, the important things should come first. 
You must always ask yourself; Is there something important that I should be doing which I am not doing?


## Bite what you can chew, chew what you can Swallow
“Know thyself”. Know your strength, know your knowledge, know your limitations. Don’t accept tasks that you can’t complete or tasks that are outside your expertise. You can only accept them if you want to learn or explore and if you have plenty of time. 

Unknown tasks are hard to predict, you never know how long they’re going to take, how much energy and resources they’ll require.


## Avoid promises and estimates
Instead of telling your boss or client that you’ll be done tomorrow after lunch; tell them that you’ll let them know when you’re done but it might take a day or two. Don’t be too direct on your estimates, you’ll never know the obstacles along the way. It usually helps to overestimate projects; it liberates you from working under pressure.

If you know a task might take 2 days, tell the assigner it’s going to take 3 days.


## Remove destructions
When you work, work. Don’t work and play. This is the quickest way of getting stuff done; focus. Put all your attention in what you’re doing. Remove devices in front of you. Gather, beforehand, all the tools you’ll need. Lock the doors. Get stuff done.


## Conclusion
There is a lot that has been shared about this topic. And it’s not every strategy that will work. The rescue plan is finding a system that works for you; we are wired differently. Being productive is a journey, it requires overcoming bad habits and creating new productivity habits. Be patient with yourself and take one step at a time.
