# You have the keys 

<sup>_22-09-2024_<sup>

You don't require anyone's permission to succeed. Living your dream life depends solely on you. The keys to your greater life are in your hand. If you feel like your success doesn't depend on you, then there is a lot to be fixed. 

You ability to succeed should not be determined by the successes of your peers. If you judge how high you can jump based on what your peers have achieved, you'll end up where they are, if not less. Don't interpret your environment as the ultimate reality. There is a lot to be achieved out there. The sky is not even the limit.

You are the one who chooses what target to aim for. And everyone, equally, has that freedom. Always ask yourself; is the target I am aiming at the target I want to hit? Is the job you're chasing the job you want or you're settling? This question can be applied in all areas of your life; relationships, the food you eat, where you live, the clothes you wear and more.

That dream of yours is about to be a reality. You just have to be sure that you know exactly what you want, and go for it. Choose your aim and spend your life and effort shooting the arrow.

The best part of this is; 'For everyone who asks (and keeps on asking) receives. He who seeks (and keeps on seeking) finds. To him who knocks (and keeps on knocking) the door will be opened.'

Greatness awaits.
