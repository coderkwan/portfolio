# What are you good at

<sup>_01-03-2025_<sup>

Guys like Scott Adams put an emphases on skill stacking; saying being good at many things is better than being excellent at one thing.


I don't disagree with this opinion, building a skill stack will increase your chances of success, it will open more opportunity doors. I like taking the skill stacking idea to a whole new level; **Be excellent a one thing and be good at many things.** 


Have an identity. There should be something that you can do better than almost everyone. **It should be hard finding someone better than you at your craft.**


A simple way of measuring excellency is noting how people nickname you; Monica the pianist, John the IT guy, Sally the Graphic designer. You should be good in such a way that you're identified with your skill. 

But, don't be restricted to one skill. Master one and know many, be excellent at one thing and be good at many things. And this will prove to be better that being a mediocre at many things. Mediocre leads to competition, Excellency leads to dominion.
