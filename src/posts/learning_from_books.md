# Learning from books

<sup>_21-04-2024_<sup>

You don't have to treat a book as a single idea or as one idea in many words. Because it is not. This post is addressing non-fiction and is not applicable to fiction more especially novels.

A book title may appear to be addressing one topic or one idea, but there are dozens of ideas in it. There are a lot of valuable nuggets shared in the attempt of addressing that single idea. And treating the book as a single unit will make you lose some of the valuable content shared along the way.


Unlike novels where you have to read the entire book to understand the whole story. In non-fiction you don't have to read the entire book to learn or gain something. You can find enough value and advice that might transform your life from the first paragraph.


If you focus on completing the book so to learn from it; then you might miss a lot. Your reading should be atomic. Focus on what a paragraph is addressing, what a chapter is addressing. Ask yourself; what can you learn from this single chapter. Treat each chapter as an individual lecture. You don't wait to finish the semester in order to say you have learn something. You learn from each lecture, you take notes on each session. You don't take notes at the end of the semester. You are also expected to apply the bits of information you have learned through tests, assignments and home works.

This is because we don't read non-fiction for pleasure, we read it to learn, to be inspired, to be transformed. That is why you must always take notes when reading. And those notes should not be the abandoned. Your notebook should be a book on its own, which you constantly revisit to relearn what you found valuable in your reading.

You reflect on what you have learned at the end of every chapter. Not only chapters, when you come across an interesting idea, don't just pass. Think about it. Do extra research if necessary. 

Your time is very important, don't waste it on meaningless reading, unless you are reading for pleasure. Your reading should be purpose-driven. Allow the author to instruct you, to inspire you, to challenge you.


In programming there is what we call tutorial hell; where aspiring programmer, instead of applying what he learns, is constantly absorbing content, jumping from one tutorial to another, with the illusion that he is learning.


True learning comes from focus, reflection and application. Don't be stuck in reading hell. Don't jump from one chapter to another, from one booking to another without actually learning or benefiting from the book. Obviously if a book is not helpful you can't waste your time reading it.


Don't rush to complete the book. It doesn't matter how many books you read. What matters is what the book did to you? Did it transform you, did it inspire you, did you get something out of if?
