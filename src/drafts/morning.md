The greatest responsibility is taking care of oneself.
I must see to it that God finds no fault in me.
I must not degrade my body and reason to be like that of wild beasts.

I will aim for balance in all things. 
I will do good and avoid extremes.
I will be concern only of my business, my will, what I can control.

I will let fate be fate. I will let the master dominate in all events.
Who should I control the uncontrollable?
Why should I fear the natural?
Is the uncontrollable formidable?
Why should I complain of yesterday?

Joyful I must be at all ways.
