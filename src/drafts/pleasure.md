We have been taught to pursue pleasure. And we are continuously pushed; through social media.

We are slowly drawn away from value; usefulness. 
We say; give me a good feeling not a good outcome.

Our eyes are blinded from seeing the future, 
Concerned only with the present, with the good feeling.

All the bad is the normal.
What we dreaded, now we dance with it.
Virtue? That's but a name only.
Duty? Is it pleasureful?

Have we forgotten who we are?
Are we not superior to wild beasts?
Are our acts different then?
Is our reasoning any fruitful?
Why then all this vice? 

That which is useful; the internet, is crawling with spiders and their web ready to entangle you, traps everywhere, to make you nothing but a slave of the platform. 
<!-- We can't accept all the negetaves; it's the new norm. -->

And some have created a careers out of it; paid to rot their brains and of their unsuspecting followers. It is our world now, it is a requirement now, brain rot by default

What makes it bad is the intention. WhatsApp is not a messaging platform; There are communities, groups, statuses (with reactions), business tools, video conferencing, voice conferencing. All these features are good, but they make it feel like there is always something to do on the app, and these features make sure that you're never bored by the platform.
