<h1>Know your tools and you'll build great software.</h1>
<p><sup><em>Written 18 April 2023</em><sup></p>
<p>There are a lot of improvements and developments going on in the tech space. New technologies every day, new libraries every minute. All these newly released tools come with a promise to make things better, simple, and fast. And we developers are easily carried away by such promises.</p>
<p>This is because we are never satisfied with the tools we currently possess. We are always looking for something better. Which is a good thing, but, very disastrous when done too frequently and too quickly. A lot of tools, libraries, and frameworks are inspired by previous tools, and some extend the functionality of another tool. This means that a better understanding of today’s framework will mean a better understanding of tomorrow's framework.
It is, therefore, important to clearly understand the tools you’re currently possessing rather than rushing for that new, immature, just-released tool.</p>
<p>To build better software we need to have a clear understanding of the tools we are using, we have to know how to correctly implement its features. A lot of developers brag about their favorite framework, but if you look at the software they built; it is painfully slow and buggy. Why? Are all these tools not created to make software better? Are they not meant to make building stuff easy?
Our problem is simple; we don’t have a clear understanding of the tools we are using. We just know the surface basics. We use the same techniques that we learned from a mere YouTuber. We even don’t know where or when to use that particular tool.</p>
<p>You find developers using a huge framework just to build a single-page static site. Which is crazy, the site doesn't even fetch data from an API. Why didn't you just use HTML/CSS?
It is very important to try and figure out what problem was that particular framework or library designed to solve. If you don’t have that problem, then use a simpler solution.</p>
